# Anatomy of a Source Code File

This section will be the first where we really start digging into the existing languages of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We have covered quite a bit in an effort to get to this point. Specifically, we learned about the useful concepts of encoding and decoding in the Breaking Barriers chapter. We learned in Structure, Style, and Behavior how each plays a valuable and distinct role in an interactive creation. In Coding and Visual Design, we mapped design-specific concepts to coding concepts to help establish a frame of reference. More recently, we introduced programming-specific concepts that help shape your understanding of how code can live and communicate in real-time.

We know code is a system for converting meaning between forms and HTML, CSS, and JS are just specific encodings. The web browser knows how to decode HTML into divisions of content and render them. It also knows how to decode CSS property-value pairs to adorn the HTML with style. Lastly, we know a runtime and engine know how to decode and execute JavaScript which enables a living and interactive creation to exist.
