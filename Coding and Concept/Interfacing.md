## Interfacing

It wasn't important until now to tell you what the aforementioned *API* of runtime APIs stands for. Now is the time. Welcome to *Application Programming Interface*. Yea, that is lengthy. Coders instead just say API (each letter pronounced individually).

An API is just an interface. The doorknob of a door is an interface. The steering wheel of a driverless car is an interface. A digital button on a screen is an interface. Interfaces provide a way to interact. The doorknob and steering wheel are physical interfaces designed for humans. A digital button is a virtual interface designed for humans. An API is a programming interface designed for code. An API allows code to talk to each other, this is the takeaway.

How do all these components talk to each other if different people wrote them? In order for components to be useful by coders, other than the original author, they need to provide an *application programming interface*.  An API simply defines how components, or code in general, may be used by another coder. An API is synonymous with *interface*. An API, an interface, allows components to talk to each other.

Interfaces are an awesome trade-off. You get ease-of-use while the underlying complexity of is the designer's responsibility. Think about it. As a driver of a car, you do not need to know all the details of how the engine works to use it. The designers take responsibility. Similarly with code, you just use the API provided to gain benefit. It is a pretty solid trade.

As you gain coding and programming experience, certain APIs will become second nature to use and you won't have to look up what they do. This simply translates to your authoring speed. Don't worry about being slow when you start out.
