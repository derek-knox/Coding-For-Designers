# Coding and Concept

So far we've broken down some barriers around coding and computers in general. We've learned about coding structure, style, and behavior too. Additionally, we've introduced coding relative to visual design's elements, principles, and constructs. Though there is always more to learn, your confidence should be magnitudes higher than when we started. Additionally, a strong mental model should be forming. Let's strengthen it even more.

To do so, we will visit one more set of concepts before getting into JavaScript itself. Virtually all of these concepts are language agnostic. This is just a fancy way of saying that what you will learn is reusable in virtually every programming language you will ever use. Hell yea.

In this section, we will visit the most important programming concepts that will help shape your future programming efforts. We will talk about the three main and distinct timeframes when code exists. These are *authoring time*, *compile time*, and *execution time*. This knowledge will help you understand the difference between when you are authoring code to when people will be able to use your interactive creations. Following this, we will visit the *frame rate* and *event loop* concepts in detail so we have a fine-tuned grasp of what actually happens during *execution time*.

Next we will talk about *interfacing* which will allow us to understand how we can actually use built-in, 3rd-party, and custom code in a reusable manner. This is also how we get different sections of code to talk to each other.

Additionally, we will explore the differences between synchronous and asynchronous behavior. This is just a fancy way of saying that something will happen *now* or *later*. This exploration will naturally tie into visiting the client and server model. We will learn the specific benefits of having multiple devices (phones, computers, etc.) communicate and/or do dedicated and unique work.

Lastly, we will look at the anatomy of a source code file for HTML (.html), CSS (.css), and JavaScript (.js). In doing so we will visit a few examples that highlight the value of two extemely important programming concepts. The first is *recycle and reuse* (also known as *don't repeat yourself* or *DRY*). The second is *work. right. better.*, a mantra that will help you improve your code authoring over time. All coders live by this, myself included.

Upon completion of this section, your mental model will be primed for programming in JavaScript. Let's get going.
