# Coding and Concept

So far we've broken down some barriers around coding and computers in general. We've learned about coding structure, style, and behavior too. Additionally, we've introduced coding relative to visual design's elements, principles, and constructs. Though there is still plenty to learn, your confidence should be magnitudes higher than when we started.

We will visit one more set of concepts before getting into JavaScript itself. Virtually all of these concepts are language agnostic. This is just a fancy way of saying that what you will learn is reusable in virtually every coding language you will ever use. Bonus.
