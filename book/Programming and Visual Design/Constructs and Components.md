## Constructs and Components

The constructs embody the elements and principles in an effort to communicate specific structure, ideas, and messages. With the elements as primitives and the principles as an organization of those primitives, the constructs are the compound results. The constructs give visual designerâ€™s the greatest chance for successfully communicating through a design. Remember, we may only influence. There are three core constructs:

1. Grid
2. Imagery
    - Photography
    - Iconography
    - Illustration
3. Typography
    - Text Content
    - Text Style

The lack of a grid can be useful, but more often than not a grid will exist in a visual design. A grid instantly provides the scaffolding, scaling, and patterns of space in which imagery and typography will live. Imagery in its various forms and typography are the core communicative components of a visual design. Imagery typically communicates faster than typography, but the content of text itself has the least likelihood of misinterpretation.

In programming, components embody the elements and design patterns in an effort to encapsulate specific functionality and ways of communicating with other components. They provide flexible functionality and manage subsystems of the root system that is the program application itself. Components give the coder reliable and often reusable functionality through a single object, a composition of objects, or a family of objects.

There is no sensibile relation between the three core constructs of visual design to an equivalent in programming. There do happen to be three high level component groupings however:

1. Built-in
    - Language
    - Environment
2. Third-party
3. Custom

Now is a good time to share an often deemphasized fact that programmers benefit from. A lot, and I mean a lot, of code you will write is already written. How can you write what is already written? Put another way, you often get to copy and paste (this is not an excuse to not understand that code though). Additionally, programmers leverage their powerful code editors to generate code automatically. Rarely does a programmer start from scratch. In fact, the first two component groupings mentioned above can be used as a checklist before having to write your own custom code.

*Built-in* components are those that come with the language you are authoring in or the code's execution environment. The initial author(s) of the programming language provide components that are "built-in". Additionally, the environment often provides components built upon the language to provide even more functionality.

As you may have guessed, a programming language never has all the functionality you need. This is where *third-party* components often come to the rescue. These are written by other programmers and they are often shared for us to use (for free or purchase). In fact, you can share the code you create for others to use too. We all help each other out. Finally, you write your own code by combining built-in and third-party components with the code you create on your own.

A component at its core is synonymous with an object that may or may not parent other objects. Think of a component as one or more objects that achieve some set of functionality. This functionality is achieved through the object's expressions, statements, and functions in addition to the other elements. The patterns help guide the set of functionality a component is capable of. Combined, the elements, patterns, and components allow you and other programmers to bring life into otherwise static visuals that display on-screen. Coding and programming are expressive, fun, valuable, and powerful skills that enable you to bring your visual designs, your ideas, to life!
