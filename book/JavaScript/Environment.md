## Environment

As mentioned in the *Event Loop* section, there is a runtime that JavaScript executes within. This runtime is also known as the runtime *environment*. The browser has been the runtime environment of focus thus far. This fact will remain. You should know however that JavaScript can be executed in many different environments.

In the *Client and Server* section, we learned that the browser is a client. Can JavaScript also be executed in a server environment? You bet. Some programs even embed an environment enabling coders to author plug-ins (new software) that extend the original program. JavaScript is a very flexible programming language. For this reason it is useful in many environments.

We surface this notion of environment for two reasons:

1. JavaScript runs in many different environments
2. Each environment expects a particular language version

Programming languages are almost always versioned... 

We will continue to focus on JavaScript in the browser, just know it has more than one home and that its home expects a particular language version.
