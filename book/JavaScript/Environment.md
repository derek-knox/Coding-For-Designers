## Environment

As mentioned in the *Event Loop* section, there is a runtime that JavaScript is executed within. This runtime is also known as the runtime *environment*. The browser has been the runtime environment of focus thus far. This fact will remain. You should know however that JavaScript can be executed in different environments.

In the *Client and Server* section, we learned that the browser is a client. Can JavaScript also be executed in a server environment? You bet. Some programs even embed an environment enabling coders to author plug-ins (new software) that extend the original program. JavaScript is a very flexible programming language. For this reason it is useful in many environments.

Though it may seem odd at first, each environment expects a particular language *version*. This idea makes a lot of sense in programming. A version consists of certain keywords, syntax, and functionality. This allows a language to evolve where changes to it won't break existing programs (*backwards compatibility*). A language evolves and can improve when third-party and custom code is so useful that it should be built-in.

We will continue to focus on JavaScript in the browser, but just know it has more than one home and that its home expects a particular language version. The code in this book is version six (ES6). It's worth noting that the subset in this book makes the code look like version five (ES5). This is intentional. The majority of ES6 additions fall in the *right* and *better* categories for advanced–not beginner–coders.
