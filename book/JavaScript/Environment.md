## Environment

As mentioned in the *Event Loop* section, there is a runtime that JavaScript executes within. This runtime is also known as the runtime *environment*. The browser has been the runtime environment of focus thus far. This fact will remain. You should know however that JavaScript can be executed in many different environments.

In the *Client and Server* section, we learned that the browser is a client. Can JavaScript also be executed in a server environment? You bet. This is known as a Node server. Some programs even embed an environment enabling coders to author plug-ins (new software) that extend the original program. JavaScript is a very flexible programming language. For this reason it is useful in many environments.

We will continue to focus on JavaScript in the browser, just know it has more than one home.
