## Subset

Just like natural languages have many words, rules, and exceptions, so too do programming languages. As we all know from experience, we only use a small fraction of a language to communicate. JavaScript—and programming languages in general—are no different.

The subset—and JavaScript itself-is broken down into four groups:
1. Identifiers
2. Expressions
3. Operators
4. Statements

These four groupings enable four respective qualities:
1. Named shortcuts to values
2. Values
3. Characters for manipulating values
4. Pattern groups of keywords and special characters



Identifiers
- reserved keywords (non-assignable)
  - using ~12/44
- non-reserved keywords (built-in but re-assignable - language flaw)
  - using ~13/61
- custom (assignable)
  - using ∞/∞

Statements
- reserved keywords used for control flow and custom identifier declarations
  - using ~6/27

Expressions
- reserved keywords and character sequences for defining values
  - using ~6/17

Operators
- special characters for working with values
  - using ~14/51

## Subset Total
 - using ~51/200
