## Subset

Just like natural languages have many words, rules, and exceptions, so too do programming languages. As we all know from experience, we only use a small fraction of English to communicate. JavaScript—and programming languages in general—are no different. 

The question is, why do extra words in a language even exist? If it isn't obvious, extra words are useful to those more experienced with a given language or topic. They enable concise communication between those in-the-know. The tradeoff of using them is a risk of increased misunderstanding as others may be unfamiliar with the words and their meaning. The subset approach mitigates this risk.

The JavaScript subset to follow is broken down in four groups:
1. Identifiers
2. Expressions
3. Operators
4. Statements

These four groupings make a program useful by enabling it to do work during execution time. Think of the respective groupings as:
1. Named shortcuts to values
2. Values
3. Characters for changing values
4. Pattern groups of keywords

Identifiers are named shortcuts to values. They enable us to use a natural-language-like approach for *identifying* something meaningful. Expressions are values. They unsurprisingly can be represented with identifers, but also as literals (like the number `23`) or *to-be expressed* evaluations (which we'll cover later). Without values, we would not be able to translate meaningful ideas to a computer. Operators are characters for changing values. Operators enable values to be *operated on* and changed. You already know about the *arithmetic operators* of `+, -, *, and /` for changing number values. Statements are pattern groups of keywords. Statements enable us to group and reason about the various identifiers, values, and operators in a particular portion of code through a small pattern.

Combined, all four groups enable us to author code that a computer understands. When this happens, it renders our animated and interactive creations.
