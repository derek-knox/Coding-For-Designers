Have you ever heard of the Pareto principle? It states that roughly 80% of the results come from roughly 20% of the effort in a system. Though this is not a hard and fast rule for all systems, it appears often enough to be a respected truth.

The aim of this chapter is to introduce JavaScript with this 80/20 notion in mind. Though both numbers are rough, the takeaway is that you can be productive in JavaScript by knowing and using a small and specific subset of the language. This approach is in contrast to knowing all of JavaScript's keywords, their meanings and respective functionalities, in addition to the various subsystems. I recommend learning them later, but you don't need them all to be productive.

The subset we'll focus on will help you author code that works. As you saw in *Work. Right. Better.*, this focus does not mean the code is not right. This focus simply provides a path for improving code authoring over time.
