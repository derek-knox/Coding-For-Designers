Have you ever heard of the Pareto principle? It states that roughly 80% of the output in a system comes from 20% of the input. Though this is not a hard and fast rule for all systems, it appears often enough to be a respected truth.

The aim of this chapter is to introduce JavaScript with this 80/20 notion in mind. Though both numbers are rough, the takeaway is that you can be productive in JavaScript by knowing and using a small and specific subset of the language. This approach is in contrast to knowing all its keywords and various subsystems. I recommend learning them later if you are interested, but you don't need them all to be productive.

The subset we'll focus on will help you author code that works. As you saw in *Work. Right. Better.*, this focus does not mean the code is not right. The Work. Right. Better. mantra simply provides a path for improving code over time.

Prior to introducing this subset and detailing its parts we'll cover a *mindset* to adopt. This mindset will lend itself to the mental model you've developed thus far.
