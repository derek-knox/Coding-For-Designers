## Ones and Zeros

Computers are dumb. They can do amazing things, but they are dumb. They are pretty needy too. We give them what they need and what they need is *electricity*.

Kind of obvious I suppose, but this is the fundamental requirement that makes them valuable to us. That is unless you like throwing computers. No electricity required. How computers *use* electricity is pretty cool though. And quite simple too. This is where the ones and zeros come in.

A *one* is the *presence of electricity*. A *zero* is the *absence of electricity*. Think *on* and *off*. Same thing. Electricity’s presence (one) and absence (zero) make a computer tick.

In fact, you have just learned the most basic code of computers. That was quick. One is presence and zero is absence. One is on and zero is off. This particular code is called *binary*. Now when you hear coders talk about binary, you know what they are referring to. Ones and zeros. That is it. Those ones and zeros are not that magical now huh?

Most coders don’t really care about the presence or absence of electricity though. Myself included. Coders just care that binary *represents one of two states*. State *1* or state *0*. State *on* or state *off*. State *true* or state *false*. Ultimately the two states can represent anything you want. State *color* or state *grayscale* for example. Only one is active at a time. You get the idea.

For binary code, the computer takes the presence or absence of electricity in (input) and we *convert meaning* out (output). What makes binary code a *code* is that it is a *system for converting meaning between forms*. Etch this in your brain.

> Code is a system for converting meaning between forms.

I could take a pencil and write a 1 or a 0 on a sheet of paper (or any two distinct symbols for that matter). I could then give it to you. As long as both of us agree on the *converted meaning*, then we would have a binary code to communicate. For example a 1 could mean "yes" and a 0 “no”. We could ask each other questions verbally and respond in this code.

There is nothing inherently magical about code. Remember this fact.
