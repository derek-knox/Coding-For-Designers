# Constructs and Components

The constructs embody the elements and principles in an effort to communicate specific structure, ideas, and messages. With the elements as primitives and the principles as an organization of those primitives, the constructs are the compound results. The constructs give visual designer’s the greatest chance for successfully communicating through a design. Remember, we may only influence. There are three core constructs:

1. Grid
2. Imagery
  - Photography
  - Iconography
  - Illustration
3. Typography
  - Text Content
  - Text Style

The lack of a grid can be useful, but more often than not a grid will exist in a visual design. A grid instantly provides the scaffolding, scaling, and patterns of space in which imagery and typography will live. Imagery in its various forms and typography are the core communicative components of a visual design. Imagery typically communicates faster than typography, but the content of text itself has the least likelihood of misinterpretation.

In coding, components embody the elements and design patterns in an effort to encapsulate specific functionality and ways of communicating with other components. They manage subsystems of the root system that is the program itself. Components give the coder reliable and often reusable functionality through a single object, a composition of objects, or a family of objects.

Unlike visual design’s three core constructs, coding’s components have no limit in count. They can however be grouped at three high levels.

1. Built-in
2. 3rd party
3. Yours

It's worth sharing a note that is not shared enough with non-coders. A lot of code you will write is already written. You essentially get to copy and paste. You rarely start from scratch. In fact the first two groups mentioned above can be referenced as a checklist before having to write your own custom code.

*Built-in* components are those that come with the language you are writing in. The initial author(s) of the programming language provide components that are built-in. As you may have guessed, a programming language never has all the built-in functionality you need to acheive what you are after. This is where *3rd party* components come in. These are written by other coders and shared for you to use. You can share the code you create for other coders to use too. We all help each other out. Lastly, you write your own code by combining built-in and 3rd party components with the code you create on your own.

In order for components to be useful they provide an application programming interface. Coders just use the shorthand, API. An API is a fancy term that simply defines how components may (or may not) be used. The only word you need to pay attention to in API is *interface*. Think of driving a car. It also has an interface. As a user of the car, you do not need to know all the details of how the engine works for example. You just use the interface and you get what you want out of the deal.

A component's API is the equivalent of a car's gas pedal, brakes, and steering wheel.
