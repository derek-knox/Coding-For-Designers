# Constructs and Components

The constructs embody the elements and principles in an effort to communicate specific structure, ideas, and messages. With the elements as primitives and the principles as an organization of those primitives, the constructs are the compound results. The constructs give visual designer’s the greatest chance for successfully communicating through a design. Remember, we may only influence. There are three core constructs:

- Grid
- Imagery
.. - Photography
.. - Iconography
.. - Illustration
- Typography
.. - Text Content
.. - Text Style

The lack of a grid can be useful, but more often than not a grid will exist in a visual design. A grid instantly provides the scaffolding, scaling, and patterns of space in which imagery and typography will live. Imagery in its various forms and typography are the core communicative components of a visual design. Imagery typically communicates faster than typography, but the content of text itself has the least likelihood of misinterpretation.

In coding, components embody the elements and design patterns in an effort to encapsulate specific functionality and ways of communicating with other components. They manage subsystems of the root system that is the program itself. Components give the coder reliable and often reusable functionality through a single object, a family of objects, or a composition of objects.

Unlike visual design’s three core constructs, coding’s components have no limit in count. They instead all leverage a core concept referred to as an application programming interface. Coders just use the shorthand as you may have guessed, API. An API is a fancy term that ultimately defines how components may (or may not) communicate with each other.
