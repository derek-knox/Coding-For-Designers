# Constructs and Components

The constructs embody the elements and principles in an effort to communicate specific structure, ideas, and messages. With the elements as primitives and the principles as an organization of those primitives, the constructs are the compound results. The constructs give visual designerâ€™s the greatest chance for successfully communicating through a design. Remember, we may only influence. There are three core constructs:

1. Grid
2. Imagery
  - Photography
  - Iconography
  - Illustration
3. Typography
  - Text Content
  - Text Style

The lack of a grid can be useful, but more often than not a grid will exist in a visual design. A grid instantly provides the scaffolding, scaling, and patterns of space in which imagery and typography will live. Imagery in its various forms and typography are the core communicative components of a visual design. Imagery typically communicates faster than typography, but the content of text itself has the least likelihood of misinterpretation.

In coding, components embody the elements and design patterns in an effort to encapsulate specific functionality and ways of communicating with other components. They manage subsystems of the root system that is the program itself. Components give the coder reliable and often reusable functionality through a single object, a composition of objects, or a family of objects.

There is no sensibile relation between the three core constructs of visual design to an equivalent in coding. There do happen to be three high levels in which to group coding's components however.

1. Built-in
2. 3rd party
3. Yours

Now is a good time to share an often deemphasized fact that coders benefit from. A lot, and I mean a lot, of code you will write is already written. How can you write what is already written? Put another way, you often get to copy and paste. Rarely does a coder start from scratch. In fact, the first two groups mentioned above can be used as a checklist before having to write your own custom code.

*Built-in* components are those that come with the language you are writing in. The initial author(s) of the programming language provide components that are "built-in". As you may have guessed, a programming language never has all the built-in functionality you need. This is where *3rd party* components often come to the rescue. These are written by other coders and often shared for us to use. In fact, you can share the code you create for others to use too. We all help each other out. Finally, you write your own code by combining built-in and 3rd party components with the code you create on your own.

## Interfacing

How do all these components work together if different people wrote them? In order for components to be useful they provide an *application programming interface*. Yea, that is lengthy. Coders instead just use API (each letter pronounced individually). An API is a fancy term that simply defines how components may (or may not) be used by another coder. An API as synonymous with *interface*. 

Think of driving a car. It also has an interface. The interface, its gas pedal, brake pedal, and steering wheel, are physical so you touch them. A component's interface is virtual so you code them. Just as a user of the car, does not need to know all the details of how the engine works to use it. You just use the interface and you get what you want out of the deal.

A component's API is the equivalent of a car's gas pedal, brakes, and steering wheel.
