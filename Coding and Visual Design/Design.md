# Design

Design is a loaded word.

On the surface, design is both a process and a product. At its core however, design is a single thing. *Design is an accumulation of decisions*. That is it. Both the process of designing something and the resulting product of that process (at any moment in time) are an accumulation of decisions. These decisions are intentional or unintentional. They are informed or uninformed. A good designer’s decisions are intentional and informed. A poor designer’s decisions are unintentional and uninformed. Just as we all breathe, we are all designers. Not all of us are good designers however. Few are great. We can all improve.

Visual, sound, experience, circuit, hardware, and software are just a few examples of various design domains. Design is often associated solely with the visual, but it is important to acknowledge that it exists in other domains. That said, we will be working with the visual and software domains specifically moving forward.

In the context of visual design we design *visuals to communicate*. We *encode ideas visually*. These visuals may be intended to teach, instruct, or entertain. They may be intended to elicit action or provoke thought. A design may be completely abstract even. Regardless, when a viewer perceives a design, an opportunity for interpretation presents itself. Remember, as visual designers, we may only influence. The meaning extracted is up to the viewer. Intentional and informed design increases the likelihood of the desired meaning to be interpreted by the viewer(s).

In the context of software (coding) design we design *systems to communicate*. We *encode ideas programmatically*. When we want computers to understand these ideas (typically for translation to on-screen visuals), we author code using different coding languages. On the web platform for example, we use a markup language (structure via HTML), a style language (style via CSS), and a programming language (behavior via JavaScript). A distinction between coding and programming is often made where programming refers solely to behavior where coding refers to all three. I will use this distinction moving forward.

Learning a coding language, like learning virtually anything, takes effort, practice, repetition, and time. Learning something new relative to something already understood can help decrease this time dramatically. This is my aim, to leverage your visual design knowledge and experience. We will review the elements, principles, and constructs of visual design *relative to programming*. In doing so, we will empower and strengthen your ability to understand programming and its core concepts at a deeper level.

With the elements as primitives and the principles as an organization of those primitives, the constructs are the compound results. Unfortunately there is not a one-to-one mapping from the visual realm to a programming equivalent. We will be able to come close enough however and create a solid bridge for comparison in the process.

Design
- Elements = Primitives
- Principles = Organization of Primitives
- Constructs = Compound Results

Coding
- Elements = Primitives
- Patterns = Organization of Primitives
- Components = Compound Results

Through the application of the elements, principles, and constructs, a visual designer may influence the meaning a viewer extracts from a visual design. A good visual designer is cognizant of their application of them, a poor designer is not. A good visual designer takes advantage and applies them with intention.

Just as a visual designer has the power to evoke meaning for a viewer, so too does a coder. This coder’s code often gets transformed into a visual design on-screen that is *interactive* and *alive*. These interactive designs entertain, educate, and empower people. Coding is very rewarding for these reasons. Empower yourself.
