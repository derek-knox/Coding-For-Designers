# Coding for Designers

*A Prerequisite for Learning and Talking Code*

Coding for Designers is a work-in-process book that demystifies coding relative to concepts designers are already familiar with. This book adds the framing that is lacking in virtually all learn-to-code resources. The goal of this book is to instill a mental model that helps designers better grasp coding concepts faster with deeper and more intuitive understanding. Empower yourself to better learn, grasp, and talk code today.
