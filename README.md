# Coding for Designers

*A Prerequisite for Learning and Talking Code*

Coding for Designers is a work-in-progress book that demystifies coding relative to concepts that designers are already familiar with. This book adds the framing that is lacking in virtually all learn-to-code resources. The goal of this book is to instill a mental model that helps designers learn coding concepts faster, more deeply, and more intuitively. The topics and concepts covered will act as reference and reflection points on your learn-to-code journey. Empower yourself to better learn and talk code today.
