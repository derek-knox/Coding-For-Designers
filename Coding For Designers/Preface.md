# Preface

Virtually all existing resources aimed at teaching people *about* or *how-to* code, introduce the code way too soon. In doing so, many insightful and empowering concepts remain hidden. Additionally, these same resources rarely consider designers directly. *Coding for Designers* is a response to this unfortunate reality.

This book is intended most for designers. If you author content as a graphic, visual, UI, UX, motion, or game designer, then this is for you. Other non-coders wanting to learn about or how-to code will greatly benefit too, but self-identifying designers are the focus. This book, the one I wish existed when I began coding, is also for an earlier time-slice of myself. He will not reap the benefits of its existence, but I hope you will.

If you want to jump straight into code though, then this book is not for you. We cover many topics before truly diving into actual software code. This intentionality helps frame *why* certain programming ideas exist as they do. Again, the goal of this book is to instill a mental model that helps designers learn coding concepts faster, more deeply, and more intuitively. This goal cannot be achieved by jumping straight into software code.

The plan of attack is simple. In chapter one, *Breaking Barriers*, we will explore and demystify a series of concepts that fundamentally intimidate most designers and non-coders about how computers and code work. From the seemingly magical ones and zeros to the code you will soon write, we will see simple, basic, repetitive, and reusable concepts at play.

In chapter two, *Structure, Style, and Behavior*, we will visit the three codeable aspects that enable computers to render our interactive creations. We will do so from both a 2D context with the web platform and a 3D context with the Unity® platform. These perspectives will help solidify the distinct role that structure, style, and behavior each play.

Chapter three, *Coding and Visual Design*, will review the elements, principles, and constructs of visual design. We will explore them relative to coding’s counterparts. This work will help shape a mental model tuned specifically for designers.

In chapter four, *Coding and Concept*, we will introduce concepts that are invaluable when authoring programming code. It is important to understand that these concepts are *language agnostic*. This simply means you get to reuse what you learn in *virtually all programming languages*. In programming languages, the terminology and often the words themselves are reused exactly or with subtle variation. Spoken languages lack this luxury. Bonus.

Chapter five, *Coding and JavaScript*, will reinforce what has been learned, but specifically in the context of JavaScript. JavaScript is the most accessible programming language today. If you have pushed a button on a web page, then you have been impacted by JavaScript.

Finally, in chapter six *Deconstructing Designs*, we will put everything we have learned to practice. We will do so by analyzing and deconstructing the user interfaces of a few impactful applications. We will then selectively reconstruct portions of the UI relative to the previously introduced concepts.

Let’s do this.
