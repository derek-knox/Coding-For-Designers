# Preface

Virtually all existing resources aimed at teaching people *about* or *how-to* code, make too many assumptions. Additionally, these same resources do not consider designers directly. *Coding for Designers* is a response to this unfortunate reality.

This book is intended most for designers. If you author content as a visual designer, graphic designer, user interface designer, digital artist, game designer, photographer, or similar, this is for you. Non-coders unfamiliar with design will benefit too, but designers are the focus.

The plan of attack is simple. In section one, *Breaking Barriers*, we will explore and demystify a series of concepts that I believe fundamentally intimidate designers and non-coders about how computers and code work. From the seemingly magical ones and zeros to the code you will soon write, we will see simple, basic, repetitive, and reusable concepts at play.

In section two, *Coding and Visual Design*, we will review the elements, principles, and constructs of design. We will explore them in relation to coding’s counterparts. This work will have helped shape a mental model for effectively moving forward.

In section three, *Coding and Concept*, we will reinforce previously learned concepts while introducing those that are unique to authoring programming code. It is important to understand that these concepts are *language agnostic*. Sounds fancy. This simply means you get to reuse what you learn in *virtually all programming languages*. Bonus.

It may seem a distant future, but learning your second programming language is far simpler than learning a second spoken language. In programming, the terminology and often the words themselves are reused exactly or with subtle variation. Spoken languages lack this luxury.

In section four, *Coding and JavaScript*, we will again reinforce what we have learned, but in the context of the programming language JavaScript. JavaScript is the most accessible programming language today. If you have pushed a button on a web page, then you have been impacted by JavaScript.

Let’s do this.
