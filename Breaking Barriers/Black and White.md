# Black and White

Get out your sketchbook and try to come up with your own code that *represents* a 2x2 black and white image. Seriously, try it. Feel free to use the visual output states below as a guide.

Your solution may differ from mine. This is totally fine. The goal here is simply to demonstrate how we can *visualize a code*. This is a primitive example with admittedly uninteresting output. Regardless, it provides one example of how to visualize a code.

The visual above illustrates a core aspect of computer graphics. If you author digital content you will have made the connection. Welcome to the *pixel*.

Pixel is another shortcut word. A pixel is a *picture element*. Do not ask me where the "x" came from. Simply put, to visualize a code on a computer screen, pixels are used. Naturally, the more pixels you have, the larger the image. Makes sense.

The sixteen variants above each represent a four pixel image. They are represented in code using a 4-bit code (half a byte). If we used a full byte, then we could represent a 2x4 pixel image resulting in two-hundred fifty-six variants. Generally speaking, the greater the dimensions of a digital image, the more bytes are required to represent it.

The above approach only allows for black and white images. As designers however, we greatly value the use of color to communicate within our creations. Take a moment before continuing and consider *how might you code color*?
